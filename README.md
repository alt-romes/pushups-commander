### Workout Bot

Welcome to the **Workout Bot**'s git repository!

The source of the website is on `/docs`, and the bot's main code in haskell is
on `/pushups-logic`.

The name of the repo and source files was kept from its early days in which
tracking pushups was *the* goal.

More information can be found on the main webpage and documentation
